### Did you know that Yahoo is hiring Node.js developers in their SF Office?

We're already using Node.js in production across a variety of high traffic sites. The new My Yahoo,
Premier League Fantasy Football, and the recently launched Yahoo Screen, are
all running on Node. In the next 12 months we're on track to easily
become the largest originator of traffic from Node in the world.

We've also built an amazing infrastructure. We run the latest version of
Node, host our own NPM registry, and deploy seemlessly from a Github
pull request all the way to production. In fact, we deploy more than 400
times, and run more than 360,000 tests everyday.

Want to write server side or client side JS for more than 800 million monthly users?
